Python Homework: PyBank

The solution is in main.py
It analyzes Resources/budget_data.csv to extract the following info:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The analysis is printed on the terminal and saved in a text file ./PyBank_analysis.txt
